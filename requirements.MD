System Name: News Feed Curator

Purpose and Scope

The News Feed Curator is designed to subscribe to various textual news feeds and filter them using the capabilities of ChatGPT, with the objective of providing a curated stream of resource links (news, research, GitHub repositories, Twitter posts, blog posts, etc.). The output links will be evaluated for duplication, relevance, quality, credibility, and freshness.

System Overview

The system will ingest feeds from various sources, including but not limited to RSS, Telegram, Discord channels, Subreddits, Slack, and Google Alerts. These feeds will be processed and evaluated by external subsystems for duplication, summarization, relevance, quality, credibility, and freshness. The system's user interface will be command-line based, and all processing logs, including errors and operational information, will be recorded to a file for monitoring and debugging purposes.

Functional Requirements

3.1 Feed Subscription

The system must be able to manually subscribe and ingest feeds from the following sources:
RSS
Telegram
Discord Channels
Subreddits
Slack
Google Alerts

The system should be designed with the capability to add new feed sources with minimal changes. The system should not prioritize any specific feeds and should be allowed to subscribe to any of the above. Subscription information will be managed through a settings.json file located in the same directory the system is run from. New subscriptions are added and old subscriptions are removed manually by modifying this file.

3.2 Feed Processing
The system must be able to process feeds in batches at regular intervals as determined by a configurable value in the settings.json file. The feed data will be in the format as specified by the feed source format. Appropriate libraries should be used for accessing the feeds. The system will interact with the following external subsystems:

Duplication Measurement Subsystem: This subsystem will provide a score indicating the likelihood that the feed item is a duplicate of an existing item. The system must be able to accept and record this score for each feed item. Items which score above a configured score for duplication, as determined in the settings.json file, will not be processed.

Summarization Subsystem: This subsystem will provide a summary of each feed item. The system must be able to accept and record this summary for each feed item.

Relevance Subsystem: This subsystem will provide a relevance score for each feed item. The system must be able to accept and record this score for each feed item.

Quality Subsystem: This subsystem will provide a quality score for each feed item. The system must be able to accept and record this score for each feed item.

Credibility Subsystem: This subsystem will provide a credibility score for each feed item. The system must be able to accept and record this score for each feed item.

Freshness Subsystem: This subsystem will provide a freshness score for each feed item. The system must be able to accept and record this score for each feed item.

The system must handle cases where external subsystems take a long time to return results or return with errors. In case of errors, the system should log the error and skip to the next feed item. If there are a configurable number of errors in a row as determined in the settings.json file, the system should shut down.

3.3 Data Storage

The system must be able to pass processed feed items to an external data storage subsystem for permanent storage. The system must be designed to handle any necessary error checking and recovery in case of a failure in data storage. The storage subsystem is expected to handle arbitrarily large volumes of data. Feed items, alongside their summaries and scores, will be stored in this subsystem.

3.4 User Interface

The system will provide a command-line interface for operation. The interface should support a command to start the system,which will read configuration information (feed settings and subsystem information) from the settings.json file. The system can be stopped by the user by killing the process.

The system must provide logging to a file about how feeds are being processed and placed into the database. Log files should be in a standard pythonic log format and should contain information about when the system tries to retrieve the latest feed information, any information reported back by subsystems as it uses each subsystem in turn, and any errors encountered. Both errors and operational information should be logged.

Non-functional Requirements

4.1 Scalability

The system should be designed to handle hundreds of feeds at launch, with the ability to scale up to a maximum of 1000 feed sources. The rate of growth in the number of feeds is not specified for this document, but the system should be scalable. Specific scalability requirements, such as the speed of scaling up or down, are not specified in this document.

4.2 Security

The system will be installed on a secure server and may need to connect to external feeds via HTTPS. Connection secrets will be stored in plain text in the settings.json file, as the installation system is assumed to be secure. No additional security protocols or standards are specified for the system in this document.

4.3 Maintainability

The system should be easy to maintain and update. Log files should be easily readable and should provide clear indications of any issues that occur during operation. Specific expectations for the frequency of updates and maintenance are not specified in this document. The system does not need to support specific features for ease of maintenance, such as automated system health checks or error notifications.

Assumptions and Dependencies

The system's operation is dependent on various external subsystems for duplication measurement, summarization, relevance scoring, quality scoring, credibility scoring, freshness scoring, and data storage. The availability and operation of these subsystems are assumed to be reliable. The subsystems will be available via programmatic APIs that can be loaded at runtime.

If any of the subsystems become unavailable, the system should log an error with the feed item. If there are a configurable number of errors in a row, as specified in the settings.json file, the system should shut down.

No specific future enhancements need to be considered in the system design for this 
requirements document. The system should, however, be designed with a degree of flexibility to accommodate potential future changes.
